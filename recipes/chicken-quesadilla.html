        <h2>The Yummiest Stuff ever!</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Burrito Size Tortillas: This recipe works with any size of flour tortilla, but I prefer the burrito size because you can stuff a lot more in them!</li>
            <li>Diced Grilled Chicken: Make your chicken any way you like! You can use my recipe for street taco chicken, slow cooker shredded chicken, instant pot chicken, or my cilantro lime chicken. You can also use leftover grilled chicken or shredded rotisserie chicken.
            </li>
            <li>Shredded Cheese: I prefer a Colby Jack, Monterey Jack, or Chihuahua cheese but you can use any melty cheese you like. A Mexican three-cheese blend or a mild cheddar cheese both work well too!
            </li>
            <li>Homemade Taco Bell Quesadilla Sauce: My copycat Taco Bell quesadilla sauce is a MUST for this recipe! Once you have a quesadilla with it, you'll never want a plain quesadilla again! This quesadilla sauce is made with simple ingredients including mayo, sour cream, pickled jalapenos, jalapeno juice, cumin, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika. It comes together in a food processor in just minutes and adds a delicious layer of flavor and a creamy texture to the quesadillas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Assemble the quesadillas by dividing the ingredients evenly between the 4 tortillas, adding the ingredients just to one half of each tortilla.</li>

            <li>Fold tortillas over.</li>
            <li>Cook quesadillas one at a time for a few minutes on each side or until they are golden brown on both sides.</li> 
            <li>Slice each quesadilla into 4 triangles. Serve with extra quesadilla sauce on the side and enjoy!</li>
