    <h2>I love myself some Chicken Tikka!</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Greek yogurt or thick natural yogurt - go with full fat as it's a better flavour and is much less likely to split.</li>
            <li>Garlic, ginger and lemon juice</li>
            <li>Spices and seasoning - ground coriander, turmeric, cumin, paprika, mild chilli powder, cinnamon, salt, black pepper</li>
            <li>Chopped chicken breast meat</li>
            <li>vegetable oil - for brushing onto the chicken before grilling</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces into a bowl with yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, coriander, turmeric, cumin, paprika, chilli powder, cinnamon, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix together, cover and marinate in the fridge for 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>Thread onto skewers, then brush with oil.</li>
        <li>Cook on a griddle plate, under the grill (broiler) or on the barbecue for 8-10 minutes until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve with a sprinkling of freshly chopped coriander.</li>
    </ol>
